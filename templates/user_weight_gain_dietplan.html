        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Gaining weight can be just as challenging as losing weight. While the main focus is to increase energy and protein intakes, it is also important to maintain a healthy balanced diet without eating too many foods that might have high amounts of calories but little in the way of good nutrition.</p>
        <p>This 7-day weight gain meal plan provides one example of how to achieve a higher protein and higher calorie intake from healthy energy-giving foods such as lean meat, dairy, eggs, seeds, and nuts, which will assist you to enjoy your food while working your way toward achieving your weight gain goals.</p>
        <p>Those with a medical issue should seek advice from a medical practitioner before changing their diet.</p>
